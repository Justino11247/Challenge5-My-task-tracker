## About 

This is the **Module 05 Challenge Project**. The point of this project was to add my new knowledge of Web-APIs and previous knowledge of Javascript, CSS, and HMTL to a project for which I was given some starter code. The finished product is a task tracker that tracks and displays your entries using the local storage to set and pull items into a to-do list

## The Purpose 

The purpose of this application is to give users a space to track all of their tasks in their day to day life. It asks for the task name, due date, and description. After they add the task it is displayed o nthe page for the user to move into different progress stages or delete!

## Usage
 
 When the user first loads up this application, they will be prompted to add a new task. Once they have filled out the form and press the 'add task' button, their task will be displayed in the "To Do" column. The color of the task will depend on whether they are before, on or after the due date. The user will then be able to drag the task along different columns to show that it is either in progress or completed! Once they have completed the task and need to make space to add new tasks, they will hit the delete button and the task will disappear. Happy Tasking!
